<h1>About Thumbs Down</h1>

<section>
<h2>Our Purpose and Mission</h2>
<p>Thumbs Down exists to provide comprehensive information about one of humanity's most recognizable gestures. This simple hand signal carries centuries of history and cultural weight, yet many people use it daily without understanding its origins, variations, or implications. Our mission is to document everything related to the thumbs down gesture—from ancient Roman arenas to modern social media platforms—in an accessible, well-researched format.</p>
<p>We created this resource after noticing the scattered and often contradictory information available online about thumbs down. Some sources perpetuate myths about Roman gladiators without acknowledging scholarly debates. Others discuss social media dislike buttons without examining their psychological impacts. We aim to consolidate accurate, nuanced information in one place, serving students, researchers, designers, communicators, and anyone curious about this ubiquitous gesture.</p>
<p>Our content covers historical origins, cultural variations, digital implementations, psychological effects, and practical applications. We examine how Siskel and Ebert transformed thumbs down into a film criticism tool, why platforms like Facebook avoid dislike buttons, and what the gesture means in different countries. By exploring thumbs down from multiple angles, we help readers understand not just what the gesture means, but why it matters in human communication.</p>

<h2>The Three-Tier Rating System</h2>
<p>While thumbs down and thumbs up create a simple binary, real human opinions rarely fit neatly into two categories. This is why the three-tier system—thumbs up, thumbs sideways, and thumbs down—has gained traction in various feedback contexts. The sideways thumb represents the vast middle ground where most experiences actually fall: satisfactory but not exceptional, flawed but not terrible, or genuinely mixed.</p>
<p>Corporate environments particularly benefit from three-tier systems. Employee performance reviews using only "satisfactory" or "unsatisfactory" force managers into false binaries that don't reflect reality. Adding a middle tier like "meets expectations" or "needs development" provides crucial nuance. Customer satisfaction surveys similarly find that three options capture sentiment more accurately than two or five—enough granularity to be useful without overwhelming respondents with choices.</p>
<p>The three-tier approach appears throughout our <a href="/">homepage</a> and <a href="/faq">FAQ sections</a> because it represents how people actually think about approval and disapproval. Pure binary systems force decisions that may not reflect true opinions, potentially skewing data and creating frustration. However, the sideways thumb lacks the universal recognition of its up and down counterparts, meaning it requires more explanation in cross-cultural contexts. Organizations implementing three-tier systems must clearly define what each gesture means to avoid confusion and ensure consistent application across evaluators.</p>

<h2>Commitment to Accuracy and Authority</h2>
<p>Every claim on Thumbs Down is supported by credible sources. We cite academic research from institutions like Stanford University and the University of California Berkeley, reference historical analyses from the <a href="https://www.si.edu/">Smithsonian Institution</a>, and link to data from organizations like the Pew Research Center. When discussing platform policies, we verify information through official company announcements and tech journalism from established outlets.</p>
<p>We acknowledge uncertainty where it exists, particularly regarding ancient Roman practices. Rather than presenting the gladiator death signal as established fact, we explain the scholarly debate and note how 19th-century art shaped modern perceptions. This intellectual honesty distinguishes our content from sources that prioritize compelling narratives over historical accuracy.</p>
<p>Our commitment extends to regularly updating information as platforms change policies, new research emerges, and cultural practices evolve. Social media features change frequently—YouTube's removal of public dislike counts in 2021 and Twitter's experimental downvote tests in 2022 required content updates. We monitor these developments to ensure our information remains current and useful. When you read about thumbs down here, you're getting information that reflects both historical understanding and contemporary reality, properly sourced and contextualized for practical application. Our examination of negative feedback psychology draws on research standards established by organizations like the <a href="https://www.apa.org/">American Psychological Association</a> to ensure scientific accuracy. Historical gesture documentation and cultural archives from the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/">Library of Congress</a> inform our understanding of how thumbs down evolved in American culture.</p>
